# COVID-19-Detection-from-Lung-X-rays

Overview

This repository develops a machine learning model to classify chest X-rays as either healthy or indicative of pneumonia, specifically caused by the COVID-19 virus. The developed model powers an AI application aimed at faster detection of the coronavirus from X-ray images of patients' lungs.

Dataset

The dataset used for training and validation consists of chest X-ray images of both healthy individuals and patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia. The dataset has been preprocessed and organized to facilitate model training. Due to privacy and ethical considerations, the dataset used in this project cannot be shared within this repository. 

Model Development

The machine learning model leverages deep learning techniques and is built using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture has been designed to effectively differentiate between healthy and pneumonia-affected lung X-rays. The training process, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics are detailed within the code and accompanying documentation.
